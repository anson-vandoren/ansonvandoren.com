## What Makes Me Tick

**I hate being bored.**

>I'll do just about anything to avoid monotony, and I've quit jobs once the challenge was gone.

**I love learning new things.**

> The "what" matters a bit less, though I tend to focus on technology/math/science/geek stuff.

**Crafting code is what drives me.**

> I learned Commodore BASIC at age 8. Programming has been my passion ever since.

## What I'm Currently Doing

**Director of Systems Engineering at Kateeva, Inc.**

> _I spend most of my time figuring out how to make extraordinarily complex high-volume mass production machines seem simple and easy to their owners. I run a multidisciplinary team that translates business into system requirements, creates the interfaces between sub-systems, owns machine vision and control systems, and drives overall system integration and optimization from concept to installation at a customer site._

**Building tools for automated trading**

> _Because a day job isn't enough to keep me entertained, I'm also digging into quantitative finance and learning how to apply that to cryptocurrency trading and traditional equity markets. Building stuff with Python, Binance, Robinhood, and Go._
