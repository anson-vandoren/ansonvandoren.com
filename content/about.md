## What Makes Me Tick

**I hate being bored.**

>I'll do just about anything to avoid monotony, and I've quit jobs once the challenge was gone.

**I love learning new things.**

> The "what" matters a bit less, though I tend to focus on technology/math/science/geek stuff.

**Crafting code is what drives me.**

> I learned Commodore BASIC at age 8. Programming has been my passion ever since.

## What I'm Currently Doing

**Director of Software & Systems Engineering at Kateeva, Inc.**

> _I spend much of my time working to make complex high-volume mass production equipment
> seem simple and easy to its owner. I lead a team that converts business requirements into
> system requirements, designs and implements the human and factory interfaces, translates
> additive manufacturing algorithms into machine control software,
> and drives overall system integration and optimization from concept to installation at a
> customer site._

**Building use(ful | less) electronics projects**

> _Because a day job isn't enough to keep me entertained (and because quarantine means more
> time spent at home these days), I'm building things like automated thermostats, EEPROM
> programmers, oh... and an 8-bit CPU from SN7400 logic chips._

> _Switching back and forth between contributing to various open source projects (mainly around web development and quantitative finance), and building my own stuff with Python, Javascript, and Go._
