        <ol>
            <li>The goal is to make the entire board the same color as the top-left square.</li>
            <li>Click on a square adjacent to the connected squares to change their color.</li>
            <li>Connected squares are those that share a color with the top-left square and are directly or indirectly adjacent to it.</li>
            <li>Only adjacent squares can be clicked; clicking a non-adjacent square does not count as a turn and nothing will happen.</li>
            <li>Keep track of the number of clicks it takes to complete the game!</li>
        </ol>
